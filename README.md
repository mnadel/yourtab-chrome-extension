# Your Tab

Own your new tabs: a Chrome plugin to load content in your new tabs.

# Premise

Each time I Ctrl-T in Chrome/ium, I want to see what's going on in the world. There's an MSN extension
that sort of solves this problem, but has two limitations:

1. It's hard-coded to MSN News, which is littered with paid content
1. It hides the Bookmarks Bar on new tabs, which I find very useful

This extension solves both of these problems. It defaults to AP News, but is configurable. It also
optionally shows you your bookmarks.

# Installing

In `chrome://extensions`, enable developer mode, select _Load unpacked_ and point Chrome at the directory
containing this repo's `manifest.json` file.
